Hi everybody! My name is Florin Ratajczak (@fratajcz) and I am currently pursuing my PhD at Helmholtz Munich. My research interests are applications of graph neural networks in biomedicine. Why? While neural networks designed for 1D or 2D data (i.e. language or images) are celebrating breathtaking victories through ChatGPT and MidJourney, this type of data is rare in biomedice. Of course you can take pictures of cells and in some cases that might be very useful, but these pictures will not tell you what is actually happening in and between these cells! For the last decades, a considerable effort went into mapping various types of connections and communication between cells, metabolites and proteins. Huge and detailed maps have been created by hundreds of thousands of researchers meticulously studying each interaction and providing new pieces to the puzzle. While still incomplete, these maps have grown increasingly complex and their availability is steadily increasing. Right when the amount of network-shaped data in biomedicine is exploding, a new technology made its debut in 2017: Graph Neural Networks! This generalization of the 2D convolution operator allows the processing of arbitrary-shaped data, where each point can have any number of connections, including none. Graphs are nothing else than networks, so their uptake to solve biomedical problems was just a matter of time. However, with their great flexibility, many questions arose on how to optimally use graph neural networks in that context. As it turned out, many biomdeical networks are not well suited to be used with graph neural networks, or at least with most of the graph convolutions that we have today. I made it my goal to investigate why this is the case and to find ways to better use graph neural networks for biomedical networks, finally unleashing their true potential for this important field of research!
